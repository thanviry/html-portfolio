*/<h1>About Me</h1>

 <! Name, Grade, where I was born, how many schools ive been in till now (7), moving->
<p>Hey! I'm Tanvi R. Yerasi - my initials are TRY =] - and I was born in Lafayette, Louisiana, in the U.S. I'm in 8th grade right now, but I've been in 7 schools until now, and I joined this one just 2 months ago. I was in U.S. until 5th grade, and then moved to India for 6th grade. Then I went back to the U.S. for the first half of 7th grade, but then came back to India for the 2nd half. Then I switched schools at the end of 7th grade to my school now. I hope I'll stay in this school longer than a year!</p>

<! Hobbies >
<p>I absolutely love reading, and I've read 344 books since last year as of now. I love music too, and when I'm free, I usually alternate between tabs of an online pdf, Pinterest, and YouTube.</p>

<! How I started coding->
<p>I started coding when my dad introduced me to a course on Udemy called "FullStack" and we've been following Angela since then. Right now, this is only my 4th Module, and I don't know what I'll do with this later on.</p>
